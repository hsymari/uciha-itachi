                    <h1>Uciha Itachi</h1>
                    <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.</p>

                <p> The Uchiha Clan (うちは一族, Uchiha Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure,[20] reputed to be the village's strongest because of their Sharingan and natural battle prowess.[21] After helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew increasingly isolated from the village's affairs, culminating in most of their deaths during the Uchiha Clan Downfall. Few Uchiha now survive into the present day.</p>

                <p>The Ōtsutsuki Clan (大筒木一族, Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku) is an ancient clan of horned human-like creatures known as celestial beings (天津人, amatsubito),[12] and also described as aliens (宇宙人, uchūjin),[13][14] and revered as equivalent to gods.[15] As a parasitic species, they have spent thousands of years traversing through the cosmos in order to carry out the Ōtsutsuki Will (大筒木の意志, Ōtsutsuki no Ishi), a doctrine which dictates that clan members consume the life energy and genetic material of other worlds in order to continuously evolve, with the ultimate goal of attaining godhood. After the arrival of Kaguya on Earth a millennium ago, the Ōtsutsuki began having a lasting influence on the human population, notably starting the history of shinobi.[16]</p>

                <p> The Uzumaki Clan (うずまき一族, Uzumaki Ichizoku) was a formerly prominent clan in Uzushiogakure. Its members are renown for having bright, red hair, possessing incredibly strong life-forces and chakra, and their prowess in fūinjutsu. Despite the fall of Uzushiogakure and decline of the clan, it never quite went extinct as most of its known members have since resided in Konohagakure. The clan itself was recognised as active again 15 years after the Fourth Shinobi World War.[22]</p>

                <p> The Senju Clan (千手一族, Senju Ichizoku) was one of the clans responsible for founding the first shinobi village: Konohagakure — the other being their rival Uchiha clan. Although the clan itself no longer appears to exist as a group, the Senju continue to influence Konoha's politics through their philosophy of the Will of Fire and the corresponding interpretation of the role of the Hokage position. As such, three Senju have achieved the position of Hokage.</p>
